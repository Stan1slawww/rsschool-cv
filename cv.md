## **About me**

_Hello, my name is Stas, I'm 20 years old and I'm from Belarus. A few months ago I graduated from college where I studied to become an electrician. I had no programming experience, but in my third year of college I realized that this profession was more to my liking than the one I was studying for. Having studied possible directions in programming, I decided that I wanted to become a FrontEnd developer, I prefer developing websites and web pages, since I am a creative person and have been distinguished by creativity, resourcefulness and perseverance since childhood. Since Iâ€™m just studying to become a programmer, I had no work experience in this area, but I had a lot of experience earning money from other jobs. Secondary education._

 _The level of my English is weak, but I continue to learn it in order to solve many problems in the future_
